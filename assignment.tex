\title{Case Study: Propagation of contagions in complex networks}

\maketitle

\section{Viruses, diseases and the health of networks}
\paragraph{
The spread of contagions (information, viruses, something) through networks is similar in both humans and computers.
Both social networks and computer networks are examples of complex networks, attempting to estimate the spread of a contagion through them is difficult. 
Deterministic models for epidemic disease spreading were worked out in the 1980s see wikipedia article.
There are many different models and aspects to consider in disease modelling. }

\paragraph{
Multiple models can be used to explain how virus or disease maybe spread in a network. 
An infection may spread in multiple different complex ways. One of the first models created to explain how a disease spreads through a network is a 
SIRS model}

\paragraph{Epidemiology is the study of the spread of disease in humans but many of the models can be appliead to computerws}
