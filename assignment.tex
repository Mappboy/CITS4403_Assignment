Many social, biological, and communication systems can be properly described as complex 
networks with nodes representing individuals or organizations and edges mimicking the 
interactions among them [1-4]. For example, the neural system can be considered as a network 
consisted of neurons connecting through neural fiber [5], the Internet is a network of many 
autonomic computers connected by optic fiber or other communication media [6]. The analogous 
examples are numerous: these include power grid networks [5], social networks [7-8], collaboration 
networks [9-10], traffic networks [11], and so onn

The spread of contagions (information, viruses, something) through networks is similar in both humans and computers.
Both social networks and computer networks are examples of complex networks, attempting to estimate the spread of a contagion through them is difficult. 
Deterministic models for epidemic disease spreading were worked out in the 1980s see wikipedia article.
There are many different models and aspects to consider in disease modelling. }

\section{Different compartmental models}
\paragraph{
The overwhelming majority of disease models are based on a compartmentalization of individuals or hosts according to their disease status (Kermack & McKendrick 1927; Bailey 1957; Anderson & May 1992)

Multiple models can be used to explain how virus or disease maybe spread in a network. 
An infection may spread in multiple different complex ways. One of the first models created to explain how a disease spreads through a network is a 
SIRS model}

\section{Ways in which we can represent networks and disease}
\paragraph{Epidemiology is the study of the spread of disease in humans but many of the models can be appliead to computerws}
